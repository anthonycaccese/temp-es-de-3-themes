# ES-DE 3.0 Alpha-Release Themes

This repo contains manual downloads for ES-DE themes that have updated to support new features in the 3.0 theme engine.  They will only work in version 3.0 of ES-DE.

These downloads will be temporaraily available and removed once ES-DE 3.0 is launched (at which point you will be able to download these themes directly from the theme downloader).

You can find zips for each theme in [releases](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/temp-es-de-3-themes/releases).

Download any of the ones you would like to try and unzip them directly into your `ES-DE/themes` folder.
